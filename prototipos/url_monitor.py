"""
One approach to detecting whether a certain URL is being accessed on a machine using Python is to monitor the network traffic on that machine and search for requests to the specific URL.

One way to do this is to use the Python pcapy library to capture and parse network packets. Here's some sample code that demonstrates how to use pcapy to monitor network traffic and search for a specific URL:

Replace <interface> with the name of the network interface you want to monitor, and replace <target_url> with the URL you want to detect.

Note that this code only detects HTTP traffic on port 80, which may not capture all possible requests to the target URL. You may need to modify the filter or search criteria to capture requests on other ports or protocols as necessary. Additionally, this approach may not be suitable for all use cases and may have performance and security implications, so use caution and test thoroughly.

"""


# Set up the packet capture object to monitor the network interface
capture = pcapy.open_live("<interface>", 65536, 1, 0)

# Set up a filter to capture only HTTP traffic
filter_str = "tcp port 80"
capture.setfilter(filter_str)

# Loop over incoming packets and search for the target URL
while True:
    (header, packet) = capture.next()
    eth = dpkt.ethernet.Ethernet(packet)
    ip = eth.data
    tcp = ip.data
    http = dpkt.http.Request(tcp.data)

    # Check if the URL we're interested in is in the HTTP request
    if http.uri.find("<target_url>") != -1:
        print("Target URL accessed!")
